# Chat

This is a general web-based chat system, built in HTML/CSS and [jQuery](http://jquery.com) on a [PHP](http://php.net)/[MySQL](http://mysql.com) back-end.

It supports multiple channels and registration of a username/password combo to prevent impersonation. Some other features include /commands, which can be extended with you own PHP-functions, and automatic URL-wrapping.
